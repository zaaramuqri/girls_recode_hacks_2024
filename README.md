ConnectHer is designed to be a beneficial resource hub that equips young girls and women with the resources and opportunities they need to explore and thrive in STEM fields. Our platform features accessible virtual museum exhibits, a skill swap page, and an AR demo aimed at inspiring the next generation of female innovators.

Virtual interactive museum exhibits: we created this to support the interests of young learners, especially young girls who have limited opportunities to explore and learn science in a fun and interactive way. This allows young children to explore exhibits across the US even if they arenâ€™t able to travel.

AR feature: this is a simple augmented reality feature which displays a white cube when pointed at the Hiro image to their camera. This feature acts as a starting point for young girls pursuing STEM to see a demo of AR and how they could use it with their own projects. 

Skill swap: this section highlights influential female figures in STEM to inspire young girls on their journey. It also features 2 articles linked at the bottom about the impact of learning STEM and the idea behind the project.

Event calendar: 
Our calendar keeps young girls informed about upcoming STEM events, providing opportunities to connect with women in the field, acquire new skills, and cultivate their passion for STEM
